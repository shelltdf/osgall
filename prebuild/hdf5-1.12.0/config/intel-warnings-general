# Note that some of the flags listed here really should be developer
# flags (listed in separate files, gnu-warnings-developer*) but we put
# them here because they are not raised by the current code and we'd like to
# know if they do start showing up.
#
# NOTE: Don't add -Wpadded here since we can't/won't fix the (many)
# warnings that are emitted. If you need it, add it from the
# environment variable at configure time.
