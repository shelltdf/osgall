# This workflow is for running various sanitizers on OpenVDB. We currently
# only use clang over gcc (for no particular reason). Note that some of the
# errors produces by these sanitizers may be fairly obscure as the
# llvm-symbolizer is not installed on the openvdb image. The address
# sanitizer should never fail.
