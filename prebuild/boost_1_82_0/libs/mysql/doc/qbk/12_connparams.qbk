[section:connparams Handshake parameters]
[nochunk]

This section discusses several aspects regarding the establishment
of a connection with the MySQL server, including a detailed
description of the parameters in [reflink handshake_params].

[section:auth Authentication]

The parameters [refmem handshake_params username] and
[refmem handshake_params password] are mandatory. The
password is provided to __Self__ in plain text,
but it is not sent like that to the server (see below for more info).
If your password is empty, just provide an empty string.

MySQL implements several ways of authentication with the server,
in what is called [mysqllink pluggable-authentication.html
pluggable authentication]. The decission of which authentication
plugin to use is made in a per-user basis. This information
is stored in the `mysql.user` table. In addition to this,
servers define a default authentication plugin
(see [mysqllink server-system-variables.html#sysvar_default_authentication_plugin
`default_authentication_plugin`]). The default plugin will
be used for newly created users, and may affect how the handshake works.

__Self__ implements the two most common authentication plugins:

* [mysqllink native-pluggable-authentication.html `mysql_native_password`].
  Unless otherwise configured, this is the default plugin for
  MySQL 5.7 and MariaDB. It can be used over both TLS and non-TLS
  connections. It sends the password hashed, salted by a nonce.
* [mysqllink caching-sha2-pluggable-authentication.html
  `caching_sha2_password`]. Unless otherwise configured, this is the default plugin for
  MySQL 8.0. It can only be used over TLS, which makes it less vulnerable.
  This is also the reason why all examples use TLS.
  
Note that the `sha256_password` plugin is [*not] supported.

If you try to establish a connection (using [refmem connection handshake] or
[refmem connection connect]) and you specify a user with
an unsupported authentication plugin, the operation will fail.

[note
    Servers configured with a default authentication plugin
    not implemented in __Self__ are not supported, regardless
    of the actual plugin the concrete user employs. This is due to
    an oddity in the MySQL protocol.

[section:database Connect with database]

The parameter [refmem handshake_params database] is a string
with the database name to connect to. If you specify it,
your connection will default to use that database, as if
you had issued a __USE__ statement. You can leave it blank
to select no database. You can always employ a __USE__
statement to select a different database after establishing
the connection.

[endsect]

[section:collation Connection encoding and collation]

When establishing a connection, you specify a [reflink collation]
parameter ([refmem handshake_params connection_collation]), which will
determine the connection's character set and collation. This determines
the encoding of the strings sent to and received from the server.
If left unspecified, `utf8mb4_general_ci` will be used.
Please refer to [link mysql.charsets this section] for more info
about character sets.

[warning
    If you specify a `collation` that is unknown to the server (an old server
    that doesn't recognizes the newest collations), the handshake operation
    will succeed but the connection will sillently fall back to the server's default character set
    and collation. If you want to be sure, use a `"SET NAMES"` statement.
]

[endsect]

[section:ssl SSL/TLS]

When establising a connection, you can specify a [reflink ssl_mode]
value to configure whether to use SSL/TLS or not. As explained in
[link mysql.ssl.negotiation this section], this parameters can be
employed to configure SSL negotiation. This value is ignored if the
underlying stream does not support SSL.

[endsect]

[section:buffer_config Buffer configuration]

[refmem handshake_params buffer_config], of type [reflink buffer_params], lets you
specify some defaults for internal buffer sizes. You can currently set the initial
size of the read buffer, which can impact the performance of [refmem connection read_some_rows],
as explained [link mysql.multi_function.read_some_rows in this section].
