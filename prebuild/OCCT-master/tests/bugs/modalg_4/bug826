## BRepAlgoAPI_Fuse fails on revolved and sphere
###################################
## Now this test uses BOPAlgo.
## Intersection of cylinder and sphere. At that,
## the intersection line goes near to the pole
## of the sphere (near, but not through).
## Walking-line has a point in the seam of
## the sphere and neighbour point. Both sections of the
## sphere (through every of these points and parallel to
## equatorial plane) are circles with small radii. As result,
## in 2D-space U-coordinates of these points are too different
## (may be even ~60 degrees) in spite of its neighbourhood.
