# This TCL script demonstrates bug in AIS/OCAF viewer 
#
# It needs an additional DRAW command to be defined for 
# setting Width parameter of TPrsStd_AISPresentation attribute.
# The code for this command (AISWidth) is provided separately.
# 
# The problem is that when width is set to AISPresentation attribute
# and Undo/redo are made, this causes error 'width is 0' in the viewer.
# It seems that width is not kept during Undo/Redo operations.
