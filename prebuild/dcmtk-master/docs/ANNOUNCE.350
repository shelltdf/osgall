ANNOUNCEMENT

Version 3.5.0 of the OFFIS DCMTK (DICOM ToolKit) software is now available
for public release.  This release includes the following main changes 
over the previous version (Version 3.4.2):

- The DICOM data dictionary has been re-worked based on the latest 
  supplements and correction proposals, as usual.

- A new module DCMIMAGE has been added that enhances the DCMIMGLE module 
  with color capabilities (all uncompressed color models).

- The new command line tool "dcm2pnm" converts a DICOM image to the general-
  purpose PGM/PPM format.  Unlike "dcmp2pgm", it does not support 
  presentation states, instead it handles color, overlays, multiframe and 
  allows to rotate/flip/scale images upon conversion.

- A new module DCMSIGN has been added that implements experimental support 
  for DICOM Digital Signatures in conformance with Supplement 41. 
  WARNING: This module currently implements working draft 09 of DICOM 
  Supplement 41. Digital signatures generated with this version will be 
  incompatible with the final text of Supplement 41! 

- A new module DCMSR has been added that implements high-level support for 
  DICOM Structured Reporting (Basic Text SR, Enhanced SR, Comprehensive 
  SR).  Sample applications that convert SR documents into plain text,
  HTML and XML respectively, are provided.

- Implemented a global flag in the DCMNET module and command line option to 
  disable reverse DNS hostname lookup when accepting associations.

- Many bug fixes and minor improvements as usual - See the dcmtk/CHANGES 
  file for more details.
