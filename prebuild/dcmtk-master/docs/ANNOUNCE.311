ANNOUNCEMENT

The DICOM server software used during the June CAR'96 DICOM Demonstration
is now publically available from:

ftp://ftp.offis.uni-oldenburg.de/pub/dicom/offis/software/ 

The CAR'96 DICOM demonstration featured Modality Worklist Management
and Image Storage/Query/Retrieval.  The available software includes
source code and documentation for the worklist management and image 
storage/query/retrieve server applications, a number of test 
applications, and the necessary libraries.

a number of improvements over the software previously available from
OFFIS/Oldenburg University, the most important being:

- configuration using GNU-Configure
- a modality worklist SCP and SCU
- a new C++ encoding/decoding library
- support for offline media
- support for explicit VR transfer syntaxes
- a user-extensible data dictionary
- support for all balloted image SOP classes
- numerous bug fixes

The software is now being maintained by OFFIS, a non-profit R&D institute.
