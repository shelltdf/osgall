ANNOUNCEMENT

Version 3.4.2 of the OFFIS DCMTK (DICOM ToolKit) software is now available
for public release.  This release includes the following main changes 
over the previous version (Version 3.4.1):

- The DICOM data dictionary has been re-worked based on the 2000 edition of 
  the DICOM standard, the latest supplements and correction proposals.

- Support for the "DICOM Security Enhancements One" has been implemented:
  The storescu and storescp tools now support DICOM network transmission 
  "tunneled" through a secure TLSv1 transport connection. DCMTK relies on 
  the OpenSSL toolkit (www.openssl.org) for the underlying cryptographic 
  routines and the TLS protocol implementation.

- An implementation of a DICOM Basic Grayscale Print Management SCP
  supporting the Presentation LUT SOP Class has been added to the dcmpstat
  module. The Print SCP stores incoming print jobs as a set of Stored Print
  and Hardcopy Grayscale Image objects.

- A checking tool for Grayscale Softcopy Presentation States has been added.
  This tool allows to check presentation states for syntactical correctness
  and completeness.

- Experimental support for multi-threaded applications has been added for the
  ofstd, dcmdata and dcmimgle modules (i.e. the class libraries that handle 
  DICOM data in memory and on disk and the library that processes DICOM 
  images.)

- Extended logging routines for debugging A-ASSOCIATE PDUs and DIMSE command
  sets have been added to the dcmnet module.

- DCMTK 3.4.2 compiles "out of the box" on FreeBSD 4.1.1.

- Many bug fixes and minor improvements as usual - See the dcmtk/CHANGES 
  file for more details.
