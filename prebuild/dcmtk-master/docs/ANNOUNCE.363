ANNOUNCEMENT

Version 3.6.3 of the OFFIS DCMTK (DICOM ToolKit) software is now available for
public release.  This is a minor release that includes the following changes
over the previous version 3.6.2:

- DCMTK 3.6.3 builds correctly on older and up-to-date versions of GNU gcc
  (4.2.1 to 7.1.1) Clang (3.4.1 to 4.0.1),  Microsoft Visual Studio (2005 to
  2017) and SunPro CC (5.14 and 5.15).

- Tested with the following operating systems/environments:

  - Android on arm64
  - Cygwin on x86_64
  - FreeBSD on x86_64
  - Linux on x86_64 and x86
  - MacOS X on x86_64
  - NetBSD on x86_64
  - OpenBSD on x86_64
  - OpenIndiana on x86
  - Solaris on x86
  - Windows (and MinGW) on x86_64 and x86

  For a complete list of tested systems and compilers, see the INSTALL file.

- GNU Autoconf has been deprecated, running 'configure' will now emit a
  warning by default.

- Updated data dictionary, SOP Class and Transfer Syntax UIDs for the recently
  approved changes to the DICOM standard (i.e. Supplements and CPs), up to DICOM
  standard release DICOM 2017e.

- Updated automatically generated classes in module "dcmrt" (Radiotherapy) and
  "dcmsr" (Structured Reporting) based on DICOM 2017e.  Also updated the Code
  definitions from the supported coding schemes such as DICOM, NCIt and UMLS.

- Further enhanced DICOM Structured Reporting (SR) module "dcmsr":

  - Added support for the Patient Radiation Dose SR IOD (Supplement 191).

  - Added support for further sub-templates to the existing class for TID 1500
    (Measurement Report), e.g. TID 300 (Measurement).

  - Enhanced support for image entry descriptors in TID 1600 (Image Library),
    e.g. by adding a new method that allows for moving common image entry
    descriptors automatically to their respective image group.

  - Added new method that allows for adding extra content items to extensible
    SR templates.

  - Further enhanced iterating an SR document tree, e.g. by providing a new
    filter mechanism that allows for matching document tree nodes based on a
    variety of properties like value type and concept name.

  - Added another gotoNode() method to tree and cursor class, which searches for
    a particular tree node by its value.

  - Added "equal" and "not equal" comparison operators to all document tree node
    and underlying value classes as well as to the wrapper class for "SR content
    items".

  - Updated mapping of the Defined Terms for Body Part Examined in the class
    that implements CID 4031 (Common Anatomic Regions) based on DICOM 2017e.

  - Many further improvements in order to stay up-to-date with development of
    the DICOM standard and to make it easier to use this module and its classes.

- Added options to findscu that extract the C-FIND response datasets to XML
  files (either a single file with all responses or separate files for each
  response, similar to the existing --extract option).

- Added option --socket-timeout to echoscu (same as for e.g. storescu).

- Consistently use the default value "MEDIUM" for Priority in all DIMSE request
  messages, i.e. for C-STORE, C-FIND, C-GET and C-MOVE.

- Fixed various issues that occurred after the official 3.6.2 release.
