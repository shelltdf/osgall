ANNOUNCEMENT

Version 3.6.4 of the OFFIS DCMTK (DICOM ToolKit) software is now available for
public release.  This is a minor release that includes the following changes
over the previous version 3.6.3:

- DCMTK 3.6.4 builds correctly on older and up-to-date versions of GNU gcc
  (4.2.1 to 8.2.1) Clang (3.4.2 to 7.0.0),  Microsoft Visual Studio (2005 to
  2017) and SunPro CC (5.14 and 5.15).

- Tested with the following operating systems/environments:

  - Android on arm64
  - Cygwin on x86_64
  - FreeBSD on x86_64
  - Linux on x86_64 and x86
  - MacOS X on x86_64
  - NetBSD on x86_64
  - OpenBSD on x86_64
  - OpenIndiana on x86
  - Solaris on x86
  - Windows (and MinGW) on x86_64 and x86

  For a complete list of tested systems and compilers, see the INSTALL file.

- GNU Autoconf is still deprecated, running 'configure' emits a warning by
  default.  Support for GNU Autoconf will be removed after this release.

- Updated data dictionary, SOP Class and Transfer Syntax UIDs for the recently
  approved changes to the DICOM standard (i.e. Supplements and CPs), up to DICOM
  standard release DICOM 2018d plus Supplement 188 (Multi-energy CT Images),
  CP-1803 and CP-1809.

- Added "dcmicmp", a new tool that reads two DICOM images, an original
  "reference image" and a post-processed "test image" to which some kind of
  processing such as a lossy image compression has been applied.  dcmicmp
  compares both images and computes several metrics that describe how similar
  or different both images are.

- Added new command line applications: cda2dcm and stl2dcm for encapsulation
  of HL7 CDA documents and STL files into DICOM file format.  Revised
  implementation of pdf2dcm based on new class DcmEncapsulatedDocument.

- The lossless JPEG decoder can now handle images compressed with the
  Cornell codec, which creates invalid Huffman codes for 16-bit images.

- The new class OFRandom implements a cryptographically secure pseudo
  random number generator (PRNG) based on the ISAAC algorithm and its public
  domain reference implementation by Bob Jenkins.

- Major revision of the TLS code in DCMTK (module dcmtls and related command
  line tools) implementing DICOM Supplement 204 "TLS Security Profiles".
  Selection of TLS ciphersuites is now based on security profiles, and
  DCMTK now implements the recommendations of BCP 195 / RFC 7525.

- DCMTK can now be compiled with LibreSSL as an alternative to OpenSSL.

- Updated automatically generated Context Group classes in "dcmsr"
  (Structured Reporting) based on DICOM 2018d.  Also updated the Code
  definitions from the supported coding schemes such as DICOM, NCIt and UMLS.

- Further enhanced DICOM Structured Reporting (SR) module "dcmsr":

  - Added support for included template TID 4019 (Algorithm Identification) to
    the implementation of TID 1419 (ROI Measurements).

  - Added a document tree node filter that checks for the presence or absence
    of a concept name, i.e. whether it is empty or not.

  - Added new and enhanced existing code examples for this module.

- Added method getNumberOfValues() to all VR and other classes that are
  derived from DcmObject (such as DcmItem).  This new method always returns
  the number of values currently stored in the corresponding object/element,
  in contrast to getVM(), which sometimes returns the constant 1, or card(),
  which is not available for all classes.

- The ACSE timeout, e.g. passed to the various networking command line tools
  using --acse-timeout, is now also used for the first PDU to be read.  This is
  another step towards cleaning up the timeout handling in dcmnet module.

- Replaced all calls of strcpy() by OFStandard::strlcpy(), which should reduce
  the possibility of buffer overflows.  Also added OFStandard::snprintf() and
  OFStandard::vsnprintf(), which should be used within the DCMTK as safe and
  portable helper functions.

- Fixed bug in dcmseg that produced broken binary Segmentation objects if the
  number of pixels were not dividable by 8 for a single frame.

- Enhanced Worklist SCP code to make use of existing classes and functions
  instead of using its own "spaghetti" code for everything.  This also
  resolves issues with the Worklist SCP rejecting some legit Worklist queries
  as its own verification functions were too strict.

- Introduced a subset of std::filesystem to ofstd, currently providing the
  classes OFpath, OFdirectory_entry and OFdirectory_iterator as portable
  implementations for the respective C++17 STL classes.

- The Windows implementation of class OFReadWriteLock class now uses Slim
  Reader/Writer (SRW) Locks, which are available since Windows Vista, instead
  of the older implementation based on a Mutex, a Semaphore and a counter,
  because SRW locks are much faster.

- Changed version numbering of shared objects.  On Posix operating systems,
  it now follows these guidelines: https://autotools.io/libtool/version.html.

- Fixed various issues that occurred after the official 3.6.3 release.
  See CHANGES file for details.
