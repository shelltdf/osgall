directory on an accessible hard drive.

The main interface classes are:
\li \b WlmActivityManager
\li \b WlmDataSource
\li \b WlmDataSourceFileSystem
\li \b WlmFileSystemInteractionManager

\section Tools

\section Examples

For an example of how to use the main interface classes of this module, see
file 'wlmscpfs.cc' (containing the main function of the corresponding tool) and
file 'wlcefs.cc' (making use of the WlmActivityManager class that manages all
activities a corresponding SCP has to manage).
