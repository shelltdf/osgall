MODALITY WORKLIST - EXAMPLE QUERIES

This directory contains a set of example queries in an ascii-based
"dump" format.  These must be converted to DICOM file format using
the dump2dcm program.  Once converted, these files can be
used a queries in the findscu and wltest programs.

It will probably be necessary to edit the "dump" files
to adjust the queries to your worklist database.

See the documentation in dcmtk/dcmdata/docs for more information
on the dump2dcm utility program.  See the documentation in
dcmtk/dcmnet/docs for more information on the findscu utility
program.
