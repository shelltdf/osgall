# This file is used to executed given unit test commands using wine, handling
# additional arguments like 'exhaustive' and setting the DCMDICTPATH
# environment variable appropriately. It uses the prepared wineprefix to
# load the MinGW C++ runtime (stdc++.dll etc.) and helps to detach the
# wineserver process from CTest such that it does not hang waiting for it to
# shutdown.
