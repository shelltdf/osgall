.SH NAME
.B ctmviewer
- 3D viewer for models of various file formats
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ctmviewer
.I [modelfile [texturefile]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ctmviewer
is a 3D file viewer that can load, show and save 3D model files in several
different formats.
.PP
The program displays an interactive 3D view of the model, which can be operated
with the mouse (e.g. for rotating and zooming).
.PP
If the selected model file contains texture coordinate information, it is
possible to specify which 2D image file to use as a texture with the additional
.I texturefile
argument. If no texture file is given (either by the 3D model file, or by the
.I texturefile
argument), a standard 2D grid is used as a texture.
.SH GUI OPERATIONS
In addition to the command line arguments,
.B ctmviewer
offers several operations that can be performed from the 3D GUI display. For
help, press the F1 key.
.SS Loading and Saving
It is possible to load and save 3D model files from the program by either
using the buttons in the upper left corner of the 3D display, or by using the
keyboard shortcuts CTRL+O (open) and CTRL+S (save).
.PP
It is also possible to load a texture file from the program by using the
Open Texture button.
.SS Rendering
To toggle between a normal filled surface view (default) and a wire frame view,
press the 'w' key.
.SS Camera Control
By holding down the left mouse button and moving the mouse, the camera is
rotated around the 3D model.
.PP
By holding down the right mouse button and moving the mouse, the camera will
pan left/right and up/down.
.PP
By holding down the middle mouse button and moving the mouse, the camera will
zoom in and out. It is also possible to use the mouse wheel (not supported on
all systems) or the +/- keys to zoom in and out.
.PP
Double click the left mouse button on a point on the model to focus the camera
on that point.
.PP
Press the 'f' key to fit the model into the screen view (re-center and re-zoom).
.PP
Press the 'y' key to change the camera up direction to the Y axis (may be
necessary if the model was designed in or for an environment where the Y axis
is considered the up direction).
.PP
Press the 'z' key to change the camera up direction to the Z axis (default).
.SH FILE FORMATS
The following 3D model file formats are supported:
OpenCTM (.ctm),
Stanford triangle format (.ply),
Stereolitography (.stl),
3D Studio (.3ds),
COLLADA 1.4/1.5 (.dae),
Wavefront geometry file (.obj),
LightWave object (.lwo),
Geomview object file format (.off),
VRML 2.0 - export only (.wrl).
.PP
The following 2D image file formats are supported (texture):
JPEG (.jpg), PNG (.png).
.SH AVAILABILITY
.B ctmviewer
is designed to be portable, and is available for several different systems,
including (but not limited to): Windows, Mac OS X (10.3+), Linux and
OpenSolaris.
.PP
.B ctmviewer
uses OpenGL for its accelerated 3D display. When the OpenGL implementation
supports it,
.B ctmviewer
will use per pixel Phong shading for improved visual appearance. Otherwise
.B ctmviewer
will fall back to classic per vertex shading.
