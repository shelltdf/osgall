 * This header file mangles all symbols exported from the md5 library.
 * It is included in all files while building the md5 library.  Due to
 * namespace pollution, no md5 headers should be included in .h files in
 * GDCM.

 * The following command was used to obtain the symbol list:
 * 
 * nm lib@MANGLE_PREFIX@.a |grep " [TR] "
