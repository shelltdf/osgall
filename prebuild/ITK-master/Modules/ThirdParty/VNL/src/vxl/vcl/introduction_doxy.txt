/*! \mainpage vcl : Cross platform STL Library
* A suite of STL classes that will work across many platforms.
*
* Basically, when you want std::string, use vcl_string.
*
* The job of vcl is to fix your compiler.
* C++ is not just a language; the standard also includes an extensive library of classes
* and functions, which make ISO C++ a powerful and useful tool for building computer
* programs. Unfortunately, few C++ compilers available in 2001 have a bug-free
* implementation of the standard, so we have to supply our own bug fixes.
*
* Usage:
* - Instead of including standard header <foo>, use <vcl_foo.h> instead.
* - Wherever you wish to use standard class or function foo, you should write vcl_foo instead.
*
* This may seem excessive, but one gets used to it very quickly, and it quickly indicates
* to novice C++ programmers which functions are from the standard library. You might
* think that the designers of vxl{} would have been clever enough to avoid the
* vcl_ prefix by using fancy compiler flags, and many #defines. However, that way lies
* madness--trying to confuse a C++ compiler always rebounds on one.
