libminc is now compiled with cmake
----------------------------------

Shared or Static libraries?
---------------------------
By default, only a static version (i.e. libminc.a) will be produced.
A shared version of the library may be enabled using the configure
flag "--enabled-shared".  See also "--disable-static".


Finding NetCDF/HDF5
-------------------
The NetCDF and HDF libraries must be built and installed before you 
can build MINC. Teaching MINC to find the NetCDF library depends on where
the latter is installed.  There are two possibilities here:

1. NetCDF and HDF5 may be installed in a location where the compiler can find
it.  If so, you have nothing to do.

2. Third-party libraries are commonly installed with headers
in /usr/local/include and libraries in /usr/local/include.
If this is the case, you should pass the argument
"--with-build-path=/usr/local" to configure as such:

   ./configure --with-build-path=/usr/local <options>

3. Use NetCDF 4.X and HDF5 1.8.X for minc-2.1.X.

Compiling
---------
Now that things are configured all you need to do is run:

  ccmake

and then

  make install
