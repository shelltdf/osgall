  How to use this script:

0)  Use Linux or Mac, install
     - valgrind
     - xsltproc

1)  Compile ITK with RelWithDebInfo CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE

2)  cd into  the ITK binary build directory

3)  From the TOP of the binary directory type the "ctest" expression that
set(DOC  "
    selects the tests that you want to perform memory checking on.

For example:

    ctest  -R   itkHDF5ImageIOTest  -N

This will print the tests selected by the regular expression but not run the
tests (-N option).

4)  Type the path to this script in the ITK source tree and add the select expression
    from step 3 above.

For example:

   ~/src/ITK/Utilities/Maintenance/runValgrind.sh    \
      -R itkHDF5ImageIOTest

This will run the selected tests under valgrind and generate HTML that can be
opened with your favorite browser.  The HTML is written to ./memcheck_index.html
To open:

  In Linux, you can do      firefox  ./memcheck_index.html
  In Mac,   you can do      open     ./memcheck_index.html
