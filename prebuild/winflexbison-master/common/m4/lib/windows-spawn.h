/* Prepares an argument vector before calling spawn().

   Note that spawn() does not by itself call the command interpreter
     (getenv ("COMSPEC") != NULL ? getenv ("COMSPEC") :
      ({ OSVERSIONINFO v; v.dwOSVersionInfoSize = sizeof(OSVERSIONINFO);
         GetVersionEx(&v);
         v.dwPlatformId == VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_NT;
      }) ? "cmd.exe" : "command.com").
   Instead it simply concatenates the arguments, separated by ' ', and calls
   CreateProcess().  We must quote the arguments since Windows CreateProcess()
   interprets characters like ' ', '\t', '\\', '"' (but not '<' and '>') in a
   special way:
   - Space and tab are interpreted as delimiters. They are not treated as
     delimiters if they are surrounded by double quotes: "...".
   - Unescaped double quotes are removed from the input. Their only effect is
     that within double quotes, space and tab are treated like normal
     characters.
   - Backslashes not followed by double quotes are not special.
   - But 2*n+1 backslashes followed by a double quote become
     n backslashes followed by a double quote (n >= 0):
       \" -> "
       \\\" -> \"
       \\\\\" -> \\"
   - '*', '?' characters may get expanded through wildcard expansion in the
     callee: By default, in the callee, the initialization code before main()
     takes the result of GetCommandLine(), wildcard-expands it, and passes it
     to main(). The exceptions to this rule are:
       - programs that inspect GetCommandLine() and ignore argv,
       - mingw programs that have a global variable 'int _CRT_glob = 0;',
       - Cygwin programs, when invoked from a Cygwin program.

   prepare_spawn creates and returns a new argument vector, where the arguments
   are appropriately quoted and an additional argument "sh.exe" has been added
   at the beginning.  The new argument vector is freshly allocated.  The memory
   for all its elements is allocated within *MEM_TO_FREE, which is freshly
   allocated as well.  In case of memory allocation failure, NULL is returned,
   with errno set.
