/* Usual spin locks are not allowed for communication between threads and signal
   handlers, because the pthread_spin_* functions are not async-safe; see
   <https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/V2_chap02.html>
   section 2.4.3 Signal Actions.

   This module provides spin locks with a similar API.  It can be used like this,
   both in regular multithreaded code and in signal handlers:

       sigset_t saved_mask;
       asyncsafe_spin_lock (&lock, &mask, &saved_mask);
       do_something_contentious ();
       asyncsafe_spin_unlock (&lock, &saved_mask);

   The mask you specify here is the set of signals whose handlers might want to
   take the same lock.

   asyncsafe_spin_lock/unlock use pthread_sigmask, to ensure that while a thread
   is executing such code, no signal handler will start such code for the same
   lock *in the same thread* (because if this happened, the signal handler would
   hang!).  */
