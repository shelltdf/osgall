/* Temporary directories and temporary files should be automatically removed
   when the program exits either normally or through a fatal signal.  We can't
   rely on the "unlink before close" idiom, because it works only on Unix and
   also - if no signal blocking is used - leaves a time window where a fatal
   signal would not clean up the temporary file.

   Also, open file descriptors need to be closed before the temporary files
   and the temporary directories can be removed, because only on Unix
   (excluding Cygwin) can one remove directories containing open files.

   There are two modules:
     - 'clean-temp' provides support for temporary directories and temporary
       files inside these temporary directories,
     - 'clean-temp-simple' provides support for temporary files without
       temporary directories.
   The temporary directories and files are automatically cleaned up (at the
   latest) when the program exits or dies from a fatal signal such as SIGINT,
   SIGTERM, SIGHUP, but not if it dies from a fatal signal such as SIGQUIT,
   SIGKILL, or SIGABRT, SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL, SIGFPE.

   For the cleanup in the normal case, programs that use this module need to
   call 'cleanup_temp_dir' for each successful return of 'create_temp_dir'.
   The cleanup in the case of a fatal signal such as SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGHUP,
   is done entirely automatically by the functions of this module.

   Limitations: Files or directories can still be left over if
     - the program is dies from a fatal signal such as SIGQUIT, SIGKILL, or
       SIGABRT, SIGSEGV, SIGBUS, SIGILL, SIGFPE, or
     - in a multithreaded program, the fatal signal handler is already running
       while another thread of the program creates a new temporary directory
       or temporary file, or
     - on native Windows, some temporary files are used by a subprocess while
       the fatal signal interrupts the program.
