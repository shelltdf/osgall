[Bug Fix]

- Fixed two problems in SID resolution which was prevent collada 1.5 robot files from being loaded correctly.


[Known Bugs/Restrictions]

- Currently it is not possible to use both 1.4 and 1.5 in the same executable. This issue might addressed in the future with namespaces. This means collada-dom has to offer two different pkg-config files, one for 1.4 and one for 1.5.
