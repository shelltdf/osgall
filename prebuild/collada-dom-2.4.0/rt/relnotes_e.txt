COLLADA RT Loader/Viewer Release Notes
-------------------------------

The COLLADA RT Loader is a sample that was developed to load 
COLLADA document scene files, and render them using CG 1.5 on the PC,
and other platforms.

It provides scene heirarchy, cameras, animation, and skinning support 
as well as basic COLLADA_FX rendering with the assistance of the 
COLLADA_FX lib.

Currently COLLADA_RT only loads COLLADA 1.40 files and has been tested 
some though not in a rigorous fashion.  It is a sample COLLADA 
loader / render implementation in OpenGL and is not a reference viewer; meaning 
it is not and isn't intended to support everything that COLLADA can represent.  
Two such features that aren't supported are animated texture coordinates and 
vertex morphing.  These features, though may be added in the future as they are 
expressible in COLLADA 1.4x.

COLLADA_RT can be used in basically 2 ways. 

1.) To link as a lib for and used to import COLLADA data.  There are several 
::public interfaces that allow for extraction of all need refactored COLLADA 
data for real-time rendering.  This has been tested successful within Unreal 
Editor with actual Epic Game Data.  

2.) To link as a lib and used for rendering.  The COLLADA_RT_Viewer.vcproj is an 
example of this.  A COLLADA file is imported and rendering via COLLADA_RT in 
a windows PC application.  

The loader uses the COLLADA DOM for importing the raw COLLADA data and refactors 
it into renderable data at run-time when a file is loaded.  Thus the name, 
COLLADA_RT, short for COLLADA Run-Time.
